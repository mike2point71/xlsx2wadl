=========

Drop an xlsx file into a browser and then interactively line the columns up to a REST endpoint.  None of the REST part is done yet.  So far this is just an extremely rudimentary knockoff of google docs powered by:  https://github.com/Niggler/js-xlsx and https://code.google.com/p/jquerysheet/
